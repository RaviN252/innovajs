        Test Cases:
        Input;
        let arr=[1,2,5,6] N=5
        output:2

        input 
        let arr={1,2,5,6} N=3
        output: 2
        explanation : since 3 is not present in the array but can be inserted at index 2 to make the array sorted.




Advanced Questions of JS:
Write a JavaScript function that sorts an array of objects based on the values of a specified key. The function should take two arguments:
An array of objects.
A key that exists in each object.
The function should return a new array where the objects are sorted in ascending order based on the values associated with the specified key.
Test Cases:
Input:
const people = [
 { name: 'John', age: 29 },
 { name: 'Jane', age: 22 }, 
{ name: 'Mary', age: 34 }, 
{ name: 'Mark', age: 22 }
 ];

Expected output:
[ 
{ name: 'Jane', age: 22 }, 
{ name: 'Mark', age: 22 }, 
{ name: 'John', age: 29 },
 { name: 'Mary', age: 34 }
 ]

2. Write a function that takes two sorted arrays and merges them into a single sorted array without using any built-in sorting functions.
3. Write a function that checks if a given string is a palindrome.
4. Write a function that determines if two strings are anagrams of each other  
Description:
 An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once. Write a JavaScript function that determines if two strings are anagrams of each other. The function should ignore spaces and be case-insensitive. Implement a function to reverse a string without using the built-in reverse() method.
Basic Anagrams: "listen" and "silent" should return true.
Different Lengths: "apple" and "pale" should return false.
Phrases with Spaces: "A gentleman" and "Elegant man" should return true.
Different Cases and Spaces: "School master" and "The classroom" should return true.
Special Characters: "Hello, World!" and "ld! WoHello,r" should return true.

5. Write a function to reverse a string without using the built-in reverse() method.
6. Write a function to find the factorial of a given number.
  Description:
    The factorial of a non-negative integer n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. It is denoted as n!. 
For example, 
5! (5 factorial) is equal to 
5×4×3×2×1=120.
7. Write a JavaScript function that takes a string as input and counts the occurrences of each character in the string. The function should return an object where the keys are the characters and the values are the counts of those characters in the string.
For example,
"banana" should return { b: 1, a: 3, n: 2 }	
8. Write a function to remove duplicates from an array.
9. Write a function that finds the second largest number in an array.
10. Write a function that sorts an array of strings in alphabetical order.	
For Example: ['Apple', 'Orange', 'Banana', 'Mango'] should return ["Apple", "Banana", "Mango", "Orange"]
